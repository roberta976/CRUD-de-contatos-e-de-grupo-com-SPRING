A simple crud with information saved in memory with bank H2. User can add, edit, remove and list their contacts. In addition, the user also has control over the creation of groups of his contacts. So you have a Group CRUD with the group name, visibility (public/private) and expiration date information. When adding or changing a Contact, only the current groups are presented as a choice option.
